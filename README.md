# Blacklight::CommonwealthVlrEngine

A plugin for Blacklight that provides base functionality for virtual local repositories (VLRs) pulling content from the main Digital Commonwealth repository managed by the Boston Public Library.

More documentation is coming soon when we do our first real release. This project is currently in high development and in a beta state.
