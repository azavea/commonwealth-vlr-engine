# CommonwealthVlrEngine

A plugin for Blacklight that provides base functionality for virtual local repositories (VLRs) pulling content from the main [Digital Commonwealth](http://digitalcommonwealth.org) repository managed by the Boston Public Library.

More documentation coming soon. This project is currently in high development and in a very beta state.

For now, check out some [slides on this concept](https://goo.gl/GysxNK) presented at [Open Repositories 2015](https://www.conftool.com/or2015/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=49).
